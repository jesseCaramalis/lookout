# Lookout
Lookout is a criminal intelligence-sharing platform for retail organizations, where staff can make posts about instances of shoplifting or assault. Information on perpetrators
can be collaborated and shared with police by the platform, with evidence.

The purpose of Lookout is to provide a tool that retailers can use in the fight against relentless shoplifting, which is causing unprecedented amounts of loss in businesses
large and small.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node

Lookout will be based off my social media app, Plateia. I will be reusing most of the React components, and building some new ones.

## This project is currently a WIP, stay tuned for updates!
